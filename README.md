### nvim-occult
A minimalist Neovim cheatsheet written like an occult manual, stripped of hype, focused on precision.

This is not a plugin collection, tutorial, or plugin framework.  
It's a practical reference for:
- Real-world motions and text editing
- Search, replace, and file ops that don't suck
- Copy-paste, visual mode, macros, and more
- Survival-level commands for everyday use

Built to help beginners who want control without drowning in `:help`.

### Contents
- Core movement, editing, and file operations
- Visual mode, macros, and yank/paste flows
- Search & substitute (yes, `:%s/` magic)
- External command usage (`:!`, `:r`)
- Plugin suggestions for leveling up
